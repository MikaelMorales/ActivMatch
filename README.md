# EDA2019


### Technologies
- The application will be on **Android using Java**.<br>
- The server will be implemented using **Payara** (JavaEE)


### Project description:
The idea of the project is to connect people with similar interests. People can add their topics of interests and create areas where people with similar interests can match. When a new match occurs, the user is notified and they can contact the people in this group through an embedded chat. This simplifies the relationship between the users, and allows to quickly plan a real life meeting so they can discuss about their common topics of interest.<br>
The users are always in control and can, at any moment, remove one of their topics of interest or specifically hide a group.
