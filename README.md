- The idea of the project is to build a group base application. People working/hanging together will be able to create groups and join them. When all the people in the group are available, the users will be notified so that they can meet-up and either work on their project or have fun depending on the purpose of the group.
Each group will have several functionnalities such as a small chat and the ability to send files to the other members of the group.
